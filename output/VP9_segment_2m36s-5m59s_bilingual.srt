whether to overthrow America.
比他们当初在“是否要推翻美国”时大多了。

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,359
Every little comment in this interview turned into a semantic battle.

哦，你这可是爆了个大料啊，因为美国政府昨晚刚否认了，

You?
你？

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:52,920
For the party that promised no confusion around pronouns, this is really confusing.
对于一个信誓旦旦要在“代词”问题上绝不搞混的政党来说，这可真是乱得可以啊。

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:03,200
The point is, Maga World is tearing itself apart and everyone is waiting for Trump to

make a decision.

meet with his national security team in the situation room, and decide if he's bringing

Yes, that is definitely an announcement.
是的，这绝对算是个“官宣”。

at the White House.
在白宫。

36
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,280
That'll be something for the groundskeepers to take care of while you're busy in the

37
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,480
situation room dealing with more important matters.
园丁们也总算有活儿干了。

they're going to the other side.

OK, all right, be out there introducing the whole thing.

Now, back to the situation room.

So we'll have one on this side of the building.

We'll have one on that side of the building properly placed.
“那一边也有一根，位置都摆得很好。”

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,360
These are the best poles anywhere in the country, in the world, actually.
“这些是全美国，不，实际上是全世界最棒的旗杆。”

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
They're tapered.
“它们是锥形的。”

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,640
They have the nice top.

47
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,879
And I don't know if you people are aesthetic.

48
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,879
They're the fake news.
“他们是假新闻。”

49
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,359
I don't know about that.
“那个我不好说。”

50
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:24,479
I don't know there, but it's a very exciting project to meet.

51
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,559
What's going on here?
这到底是什么情况？

52
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,479
Feels like someone told him, sir, you're not doing well in the poles.
感觉就像有人跟他说：“先生，您在‘民调’(polls)里的数据不太好看。”

53
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,000
And he was like, I hear you, I'm on it.
然后他回答：“我懂了，这事我门儿清。” (注：此处为英文双关语，民调polls和旗杆poles同音)

54
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,759
By the way, what was that aside about how the fake news doesn't understand flag pole
话说回来，他那句关于“假新闻”不懂旗杆美学的

55
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,079
aesthetics?
旁白是几个意思？

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,320
I mean, this is a whole new stereotype of the liberal media I didn't even know about.
我的天，这简直是给自由派媒体打造了一个我闻所未闻的全新刻板印象。

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,640
They live on Hunter Biden's laptop, and they have no appreciation for tapered flag poles.
“他们整天就惦记着Hunter Biden的笔记本电脑，而且对锥形旗杆没有半点欣赏水平。”

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,280
Now, personally, I think it's cool that Trump found a new use for the 50-foot pole
不过，个人觉得Trump总算给那根50英尺长、

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
that Melania refuses to touch him with.
Melania死活不肯碰他的长杆找到了新用处，还挺酷的。

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,800
He was clearly having a good time.
他显然玩得很开心。

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,320
Although he stopped himself from getting too carried away.
尽管他还是克制住了自己，没让自己太得意忘形。

62
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,560
Let's have a good decoder lifting.
“让我们来一次体面的‘升杆’仪式。”

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,880
They also use another word, but I'm not going to use that word.
“他们也用另一个词，不过我可不用那个词。”

64
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,400
Do you know that it is?
“你知道是哪个词吧？”

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,639
The word is such within e.
“那个词是以E开头的。”

66
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,240
Do you know what the word is?
“你们知道是什么词吧？”

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,000
If I ever used it, I'd be run out of town by you.
“我要是用了，你们这帮媒体早就把我轰出去了。”
