1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
What's up, John Jordan?

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,940
Well, we got so much to talk about tonight.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,740
Trump makes an Irish exit from Canada.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,540
I had to DC to crash the most tremendous birthday

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,140
bash in American history.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,679
And the author, James Patterson,

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,480
will be here along with his co-author, Bill Clinton tonight.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,780
OK?

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,679
So, let's get into the headline.

10
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:28,420
Now, this is supposed to be study of broad week for Trump.

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,420
And things started out oh, so well.

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,859
He arrived at the G7 competently,

13
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:36,020
strolling out of the woods like a contestant

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:43,100
on the Golden Bachelorette, or a shaved sassquatch, you know?

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,780
You see what you want to see.

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,140
Now, this is an important G7 for Trump,

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,740
because he had to prove that he had the discipline

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,700
and wherewithal to fix the global economy after he

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,820
f**ked up the global economy.

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,020
And you know what?

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,420
He almost nailed it.

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,060
We all know the great prime minister of the UK,

23
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,420
and we just signed a document.

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,260
Mrs. Swap, I thought about that.

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,859
You went very poor at documents.

26
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:14,820
You didn't win the anti-acquiring.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,219
Don't worry, don't worry.

28
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:19,820
There's a five-second rule with trade agreements.

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,260
Trump's still totally good to eat those documents.

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,379
And I know some of you haters are going to make fun of them,

31
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,339
but Trump didn't drop the papers by accident.

32
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,459
It was a 4D chess move to check out

33
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:34,979
the British prime ministers, but don't get dumped.

34
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,659
But before Trump could sign and or drop any other trade deals,

35
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,140
he decided to peace out.

36
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,140
Overnight, President Trump with an abrupt about face,

37
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,019
announcing he's cutting short his trip

38
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:48,099
to the G7 summit in Canada,

39
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:50,299
racing back to the White House instead.

40
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:52,259
I have to be back very important.

41
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,780
I want to just thank our great-nose.

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,019
But you're probably seeing what I see.

43
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,739
And I have to be back.

44
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,420
We all know what this is, right?

45
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,340
You're at an event.

46
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,180
You have to rush home because something came up.

47
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,580
Look, I get it.

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,020
None of us like to poop in an unfamiliar place.

49
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,780
Sometimes when you have a big matchup coming up,

50
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,659
you just need that home-field advantage.

51
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:22,860
I understand, Donald.

52
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,700
But of course, the real reason Donald Trump rushed home

53
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,540
to Washington was to deal with the war between Israel and Iran.

54
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,020
And the big question was, was he rushing home

55
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,500
to help negotiate an end to the war

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
or to bring America into the war?

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,540
It's the most important decision a nation can make.

58
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:47,820
And one, that we've whiffed on for the last 10, 20, 30, 40.

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,420
It doesn't matter. The point is,

60
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:53,139
it'd be really reassuring to know that the president

61
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,419
has a clear and consistent plan.

62
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:00,339
So Mr. President, are you looking for war or ceasefire?

63
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:01,819
What about looking for a ceasefire?

64
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,779
And say I was looking for a ceasefire.

65
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:06,859
Oh, shit. OK.

66
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:08,539
He's not looking for a ceasefire.

67
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,739
We're looking at better than ceasefire.

68
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,179
Oh, great.

69
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:15,060
Yeah. Better than a ceasefire.

70
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,019
ceasefire plus.

71
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:17,979
That's great.

72
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:19,219
I hate watching ads.

73
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,659
That's wonderful.

74
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,740
This is good news.

75
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,659
I'm glad you're going to negotiate with Iran.

76
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,419
I don't know. I'm not too much in a book to negotiate.

77
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,139
OK. All right.

78
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:28,939
Not in the mood. OK.

79
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:32,819
The president's not vibrant on negotiations then.

80
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:33,939
So it's war.

81
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,780
Because who wouldn't negotiate besides you, Mr. President?

82
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,020
He's considering sending the vice president

83
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,860
to negotiate with the Iranians.

84
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,699
I think this is fantastic.

85
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,860
JD Vance is a great choice to negotiate.

86
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,860
The Iranians will agree to anything to get him the f*** out of there.

87
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,660
You know what?

88
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,500
And it's great for peace.

89
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,580
Because if Trump is negotiating, it sounds like we're not

90
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,900
going to flatten Tehran anytime soon.

91
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,660
The president warned everyone in Iran's capital city to flee.

92
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,060
Posting everyone should immediately evacuate to Iran

93
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,460
with no additional explanation.

94
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,060
You know what? I could use some additional explanation.

95
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,620
Mr. President, I am more confused than ever.

96
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,780
Please just sum up your explanation in one clean tweet.

97
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,500
President Trump has just posted new comments directed at Iran.

98
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,899
We know exactly where the so-called Supreme Leader is hiding.

99
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,860
He is an easy target, but is safe there.

100
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,139
We are not going to take him out and then in parentheses,

101
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,019
kill at least not for now.

102
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,019
OK.

103
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,780
So we know where the Iatola is, but he's safe.

104
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,220
We could kill him, but we won't.

105
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,980
For now, maybe later.

106
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,620
We'll find out next on the Golden Bachelorette, OK?

107
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,459
How does one tweet and have six different positions?

108
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,860
I mean, clearly, we're not going to get any clarity

109
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,980
from listening to President Trump.

110
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,060
Maybe other people in his inner circle

111
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,459
can shed some light on America's position.

112
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,740
Tucker Carlson, huge supporter of the president.

113
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,180
What do you think of the war?

114
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,540
I just don't want my country to be further weakened or destroyed

115
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,819
by another one of these wars.

116
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:25,540
And boy, if you can't connect the dots after 25 years,

117
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,540
the ****.

118
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,259
You're either too dumb to participate in the conversation

119
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,780
or you're just a liar who doesn't care.

120
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,100
Wow.

121
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,699
Wow.

122
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,740
I mean, Tucker, he hasn't been mistrustraught

123
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,139
since the WNBA got popular.

124
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,220
OK, Mr. President, I hope you understand

125
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,460
what Tucker Carlson is saying.

126
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,340
I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying.

127
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:49,139
Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.

128
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,259
Thank you.

129
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,099
Oh, snap.

130
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:56,019
Trump's like, go on TV and say it, you bitch.

131
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:56,619
That's right.

132
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,739
You can't because you got kicked off Fox News

133
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:01,060
for lying about me winning the 2020 election,

134
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,099
which I appreciate, you bitch.

135
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,459
So yes, Trump is not on the same page as Tucker.

136
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,899
And he seems to be at odds with some of the other top magamines as well.

137
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,179
The American people have been brainwashed into believing

138
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:20,500
that America has to engage in these foreign wars

139
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,060
in order for us to survive.

140
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,060
And it's absolutely not true.

141
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,060
Oh my God.

142
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,019
I can't believe I'm a green with marjorie Taylor Greene.

143
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:34,579
I'm not war with myself.

144
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:35,339
And this can't be right.

145
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:36,539
Keep playing the clip.

146
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,739
I'm sure I'll find something to disagree with her on.

147
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:41,739
They don't want to hear about politics.

148
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,579
They want to be able to afford food,

149
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:45,500
and they want to be able to afford gas.

150
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,460
And they just want to have fun for once in their life.

151
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,579
They want to have fun.

152
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,660
Yes, I still agree with her for once in their life.

153
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,139
Americans just want to have fun.

154
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:56,980
I don't want to war.

155
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,180
I want to dance.

156
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,980
Although you know what, I'm pretty sure Americans do know

157
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,259
how to have fun regardless of international conflicts.

158
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,379
I've never gotten a text saying, hey, bro,

159
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,500
territorial dispute in the South China Sea,

160
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,019
barbecue's canceled.

161
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,860
So, doesn't seem like Trump is listening

162
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,220
to the anti-war wing of his party.

163
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,740
Maybe he'll listen to the anti-war wing of his own administration,

164
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,300
like Tulsi Gabbard, his own director of national intelligence.

165
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,939
Tulsi Gabbard testified at March that the intelligence community said

166
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,100
Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon.

167
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,100
What she said, I think they were very close to having that weapon.

168
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,939
LAUGHTER

169
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,540
This is the benefit of appointing unqualified, crazy people to your team.

170
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,139
You could always be like, do you know how crazy ununqualified she is?

171
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:50,139
I don't care what she said.

172
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,699
So, Trump is beefing with the anti-war wing of his party

173
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,259
and dismissing intelligence from his own cabinet,

174
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,259
showing that Iran is not actually building nukes.

175
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:05,659
It certainly seems to be leaning in a Let's Do a World War III direction.

176
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,939
Weirdly enough, the final confirmation might be pizza.

177
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:13,939
According to an account on X called the Pentagon Pizza Report,

178
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,180
nearly all pizza establishments nearby the Pentagon

179
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,460
have experienced a huge surge in activity.

180
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,580
Here's why when U.S. military personnel face a national emergency,

181
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,460
they work late into the night and can't leave their desks.

182
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,700
At 8.57 p.m. Thursday, the Pentagon Pizza Report reported

183
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,379
that the closest and second closest dominoes to the Pentagon

184
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,740
had surged in traffic.

185
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,540
Oh, my God, we're going to war!

186
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:47,540
Or everyone at the Pentagon just got divorced at the same time!

187
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,180
Look, I don't know how things are going to end,

188
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,300
but it seems like they're trending in a bad direction.

189
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,660
I will say this, though.

190
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,420
If you told me after election day that within four months of Trump's presidency,

191
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,780
I'd be staring at a dominoes pizza tracker

192
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:06,299
to figure out if we're going to enter the final war of mankind.

193
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:10,179
I'd have said, that's about right.

194
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:13,860
For more on the pending war with Iran, we go live outside the Pentagon

195
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,019
with our own Michael Kosta.

196
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,019
Michael!

197
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,620
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

198
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
Michael.

199
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,620
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

200
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,259
I'm curious, Michael.

201
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,699
What is the latest?

202
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:30,980
Jordan, this is a nuanced and complicated situation

203
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,060
and the only solution is for America to enter a decades-long total war with Iran.

204
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,259
Make no mistake.

205
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:40,420
The U.S. military needs to dig in, buckle down,

206
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,340
pick up some Mikey K's meatlovers pizzas with extra tangy sauce

207
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,700
and prepare for the worst.

208
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,779
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,820
What was that last part you said about preparing for the worst?

210
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,340
Yes.

211
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,259
We'll probably need a new draft, too.

212
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,019
Millions of able-bodied young men ready to fight for America

213
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:02,379
and chow down on Mikey K's buffalo chicken supreme mam-mamiya

214
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:08,100
with a free 45-ounce Mountain Dew Code red, just like Nona used to make.

215
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
LAUGHTER

216
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,059
What, do you own a pizza parlor?

217
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:14,539
Are you trying to profiteer from a war?

218
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:15,539
No, no, no.

219
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:18,299
I have a small investment in a pizza place nearby

220
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:20,259
that I also manage and busboy at,

221
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:23,860
but that in no way affects my impartial analysis.

222
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,899
I've looked at the evidence and we have to go to war against Iran.

223
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:29,939
Possibly Iraq again and definitely India.

224
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:30,939
LAUGHTER

225
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:32,100
What did India do?

226
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,259
Well, they're a regional superpower, Jordan.

227
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,220
They're a threat to our survival.

228
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,100
Right now, their military leaders are plotting against us working day and night,

229
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,779
ordering delicious taker.

230
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,139
Michael, do you have a pizza place in India?

231
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,220
Absolutely not.

232
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,100
It's a small, tandoori kitchen called second to non.

233
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
LAUGHTER

234
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,259
Free mango lassi with every any order, just like Nona used to make.

235
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,460
Hey, Costa, come on, man. That's, this is crazy.

236
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,939
I know. With any order, Jordan, there is no minimum.

237
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:03,019
No, no, what's crazy is you're trying to start World War III

238
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,059
so you can, what, sell bad takeout?

239
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:07,700
Bad takeout.

240
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
How dare you?

241
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,500
Art Chutney is the talk of New Delhi.

242
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,220
I assume I can't figure out what they're saying.

243
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,419
But, what's the big deal?

244
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:17,500
Defense contractors can go to our nation

245
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,779
into endless pointless wars for profit,

246
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,819
but Nona, Costa, can't get a taste?

247
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:22,980
Look, you're all bad.

248
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,179
Americans don't want war.

249
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:26,979
Isn't there a way to make money off peace

250
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,579
so the world can live in harmony?

251
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,419
International relations aren't that simple, Jordan.

252
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:35,419
Two nations, their total opposites can't overcome

253
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:36,579
their cultural differences,

254
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,419
uniting in a perfect blend of magical serenity.

255
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:42,500
The only place that that exists

256
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,620
is in our new delicious sushi taco.

257
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,620
LAUGHTER

258
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,259
As my Nona used to say,

259
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,699
mmm, as we, Konichiwa.

260
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,139
Oh, yeah, we get out of here.

261
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,740
Michael Costa, everyone.

262
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,139
