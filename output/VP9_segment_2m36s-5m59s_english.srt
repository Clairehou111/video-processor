1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
or gross.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,639
But you can see how heated this is getting.

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,279
Clearly, Maga is much more divided about whether to overthrow Iran than they were about

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,480
whether to overthrow America.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,359
Every little comment in this interview turned into a semantic battle.

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,359
Really believe that.

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,879
We're carrying out military strikes today.

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,879
You said Israel was.

9
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,879
Right.

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,879
With our help.

11
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,679
I'm said we, Israel is leading them, but we're supporting them.

12
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,600
Well, this, you're breaking news here because the US government last night denied the

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,280
National Security Council spokesman Alex Fifer denied on behalf of Trump that we were acting

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,679
on Israel's behalf in any offensive capacity.

15
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,679
We're not bombing them.

16
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:37,679
Israel's bombing them.

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,840
You just said we were.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,920
We are supporting Israel as a state.

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,920
We?

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
I?

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
You?

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:52,920
For the party that promised no confusion around pronouns, this is really confusing.

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:03,200
The point is, Maga World is tearing itself apart and everyone is waiting for Trump to

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
make a decision.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,120
And remember, Trump abruptly left the G7 summit so he could rush back to the White House,

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,840
meet with his national security team in the situation room, and decide if he's bringing

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,920
America into this war.

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,200
So, we were all waiting for the big announcement.

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
And then it came.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,920
Trump sat in the truth social post.

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
It is my great honor to announce that I will be putting up two beautiful flag poles on

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,920
both sides of the White House and North and South Lawns.

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,719
Yes, that is definitely an announcement.

34
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,359
Not the announcement we were waiting for, but sure, have a couple flag poles installed

35
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,359
at the White House.

36
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,280
That'll be something for the groundskeepers to take care of while you're busy in the

37
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,480
situation room dealing with more important matters.

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
At 11 o'clock we're lifting the flag, but we're going to lift the pole now and then

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,320
they're going to the other side.

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,120
OK, all right, be out there introducing the whole thing.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,359
Now, back to the situation room.

42
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,120
So we'll have one on this side of the building.

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,640
We'll have one on that side of the building properly placed.

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,360
These are the best poles anywhere in the country, in the world, actually.

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
They're tapered.

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,640
They have the nice top.

47
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,879
And I don't know if you people are aesthetic.

48
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,879
They're the fake news.

49
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,359
I don't know about that.

50
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:24,479
I don't know there, but it's a very exciting project to meet.

51
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,559
What's going on here?

52
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,479
Feels like someone told him, sir, you're not doing well in the poles.

53
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,000
And he was like, I hear you, I'm on it.

54
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,759
By the way, what was that aside about how the fake news doesn't understand flag pole

55
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,079
aesthetics?

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,320
I mean, this is a whole new stereotype of the liberal media I didn't even know about.

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,640
They live on Hunter Biden's laptop, and they have no appreciation for tapered flag poles.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,280
Now, personally, I think it's cool that Trump found a new use for the 50-foot pole

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
that Melania refuses to touch him with.

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,800
He was clearly having a good time.

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,320
Although he stopped himself from getting too carried away.

62
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,560
Let's have a good decoder lifting.

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,880
They also use another word, but I'm not going to use that word.

64
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,400
Do you know that it is?

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,639
The word is such within e.

66
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,240
Do you know what the word is?

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,000
If I ever used it, I'd be run out of town by you.
