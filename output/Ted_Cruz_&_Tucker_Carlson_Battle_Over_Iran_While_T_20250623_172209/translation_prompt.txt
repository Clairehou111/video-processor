1. For two days now, the world has been waiting for Donald Trump to decide whether to accept
2. Israel's evite to go to war with Iran.
3. We know he's viewed it, but he still has an RSVP.
4. I hate it when that happens.
5. Now, in the meantime, the question has started a separate war inside his MAGA base.
6. And today, it exploded into a heated debate between the two most likable and charming voices
7. on the right.
8. On the one side is Ted Cruz, who wants war with Iran.
9. And on the other is Tucker Carlson, who thinks Ted Cruz doesn't know shit about Israel.
10. How many people live in Iran, by the way?
11. I don't know the population at all.
12. No, I don't know the population.
13. You don't know the population in the country you seek to topple?
14. How many people live in Iran?
15. 92 million.
16. Oh, damn, Ted Cruz.
17. Are you a pair of $800 Farragamo boat shoes?
18. Tucker Carlson owned you, buddy.
19. Ted Cruz was like, I know the population.
20. Just give me a second to count, okay?
21. Let's see, there's the Ayatollah.
22. That's one.
23. The Iron Cheek, too, is a Latin one.
24. I don't know.
25. No.
26. If you enjoyed seeing Ted Cruz get metaphorically punched in the face, how'd you like to see it again?
27. Why is it relevant, whether it will be because 90 million or 80 million or 100 million?
28. Why is that relevant?
29. Because if you don't know anything about the country, I didn't say I don't know anything
30. about it.
31. Okay, what's the ethnic mix abroad?
32. Oh, no.
33. Oh, no.
34. Oh, no.
35. Oh, no.
36. Not ethnic mixes.
37. You don't want to go toe to toe with Tucker Carlson on ethnic mixes.
38. That's his best subject.
39. Look at poor Ted Cruz.
40. He's like, I'd like to photo-friend, please.
41. Oh, shit, I don't have any.
42. I had a waiter last night at Outback and he called me champ.
43. Can I phone him?
44. You know, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm starting to feel bad for Ted Cruz.
45. So come on, Ted, you got this.
46. They are Persians and predominantly Shia.
47. Okay.
48. No, no, no.
49. It's not even, you don't know anything about Iran.
50. Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran, who says he's calling to go over
51. the government and he's calling to go over the country.
52. No, you don't know anything about the country.
53. I think there's an oxalm.
54. You don't know anything.
55. No, you don't know anything.
56. I don't care about who wins the fight.
57. I just like watching the fight.
58. It's like alien versus predator, but somehow more gross.
59. You can see how heated this is getting.
60. Clearly, Maga is much more divided about whether to overthrow Iran than they were about
61. whether to overthrow America.
62. I think a little comment in this interview turned into a semantic battle.
63. Really believe that.
64. We are carrying out military strikes today.
65. You said Israel was.
66. Right, with our help.
67. I'm said we, Israel is leading them, but we're supporting them.
68. Well, this, you're breaking news here because the US government last night denied the
69. National Security Council spokesman Alex Pfeiffer denied on behalf of Trump that we were
70. acting on Israel's behalf in any offensive capacity.
71. Now, we're not bombing them.
72. Israel's bombing them.
73. You just said we were.
74. We are supporting Israel as well.
75. We?
76. I?
77. You?
78. For the party that promised no confusion around pronouns, this is really confusing.
79. The point is, Maga World is tearing itself apart and everyone is waiting for Trump to
80. make a decision.
81. And remember, Trump abruptly left the G7 summit so he could rush back to the White House, meet
82. with his National Security team in the situation room and decide if he's bringing America into
83. this war.
84. So, we were all waiting for the big announcement.
85. And then it came.
86. Trump said in a truth social post, it is my great honor to announce that I will be putting
87. up two beautiful flag polls on both sides of the White House and North and South Lawns.
88. Yes, that is definitely an announcement.
89. Not the announcement we were waiting for, but sure, have a couple flag polls installed
90. at the White House.
91. That will be something for the groundskeepers to take care of while you're busy in the
92. situation room dealing with more important matters.
93. At 11 o'clock we're lifting the flag, but we're going to lift the poll now and then they
94. go into the other side.
95. Okay.
96. But I'd be out there introducing the whole thing.
97. Now, back to the situation room.
98. So we'll have one on this side of the building.
99. We'll have one on that side of the building properly placed.
100. These are the best polls anywhere in the country, in the world, actually.
101. They're tapered.
102. They have the nice top.
103. I don't know if you people are aesthetic.
104. You know they're the fake news.
105. I don't know about it.
106. I don't know there.
107. But it's a very exciting project to meet.
108. What's going on here?
109. Feels like someone told him, sir, you're not doing well in the polls and he was like,
110. I hear you, I'm on it.
111. And by the way, what was that aside about how the fake news doesn't understand flag poll
112. aesthetics?
113. I mean, this is a whole new stereotype of the liberal media I didn't even know about.
114. They live on 100 Binds laptop and they have no appreciation for tapered flag polls.
115. Now, personally, I think it's cool that Trump found a new use for the 50-foot poll that
116. Melania refuses to touch him with.
117. He was clearly having a good time, although he stopped himself from getting too carried
118. away.
119. Let's have a good, they call it a lifting.
120. They also use another word, but I'm not going to use that word.
121. You know that is?
122. The word starts with an E. You know what the word is?
123. If I haven't used it, I'd be run out of town by you people.
124. All right, so enjoy it.
125. Come on, Donald.
126. You think if you say the word erection, we're going to all act like children and take it
127. out of context.
128. I mean, come on.
129. Come on.
130. Where'd you get a silly idea like that?
131. I'm going to come.
132. Okay, y'all.
133. Now I remember, right.
134. It's crazy for Trump to suddenly get all worried about saying erection.
135. His closing campaign message was vote for me.
136. I saw Arnold Palmer's incredible penis.
137. But okay, you came out, you talked about flag polls, you've met the flagpole guys, you
138. made some flagpole-related dick jokes, time to turn around, go back inside and stop and
139. or escalate this war.
140. Let's not waste any more time.
141. Say what you want about Biden.
142. He was it for open borders.
143. He wasn't for transgender for everybody.
144. We don't know where it's coming from, sir.
145. I said, check out the tariffs.
146. He calls back about a day later.
147. Wow.
148. Somewhere in this group, somebody that is going to captivate some movie producer, not
149. every Wednesday.
150. The only thing too late is Powell.
151. Powell's too late.
152. Too late, pal.

154. Too late.
155. You ever have a guy that's not a smart person and you're dealing with it.

161. You know what I do whenever they talk about Gavin Newskin?
162. I say, look at the real.
163. Austria has very, very flammable cheese.
164. Good Lord.
165. I don't want to say anything, but if your flagpole erections last more than four hours,
166. you probably want to see a doctor.
167. Donald.
168. Donald.
169. Focus.
170. Focus.
171. Focus, focus, focus.
172. Get back to the flag, Paul.
173. No way.
174. Get back to the war.
175. I mean, war.
176. He's got me all mixed up.
177. Just someone, ask him about the war.
178. Have you even answered questions about whether you are moving closer or you believe the US
179. is moving closer to striking Iranian nuclear facilities?
180. Where's your mindset on that?
181. I may do it.
182. I may not do it.
183. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do.
184. Right.
185. Super-helpful.
186. Thanks, guy.
187. That is the key to this whole thing.
188. Nobody knows what he wants to do, including Donald Trump.

191. And honestly, I agree.

193. to bringing America into another Middle East war.
