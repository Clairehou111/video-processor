1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,839
For two days now, the world has been waiting for Donald Trump to decide whether to accept

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,359
Israel's evite to go to war with Iran.

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,280
We know he's viewed it, but he still has an RSVP.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,320
I hate it when that happens.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,760
Now, in the meantime, the question has started a separate war inside his MAGA base.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,240
And today, it exploded into a heated debate between the two most likable and charming voices

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,560
on the right.

8
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:31,239
On the one side is Ted Cruz, who wants war with Iran.

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,879
And on the other is Tucker Carlson, who thinks Ted Cruz doesn't know shit about Israel.

10
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:39,280
How many people live in Iran, by the way?

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,439
I don't know the population at all.

12
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,239
No, I don't know the population.

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,480
You don't know the population in the country you seek to topple?

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,480
How many people live in Iran?

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
92 million.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,879
Oh, damn, Ted Cruz.

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,320
Are you a pair of $800 Farragamo boat shoes?

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,960
Tucker Carlson owned you, buddy.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,439
Ted Cruz was like, I know the population.

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,560
Just give me a second to count, okay?

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,960
Let's see, there's the Ayatollah.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
That's one.

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,640
The Iron Cheek, too, is a Latin one.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
I don't know.

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
No.

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,000
If you enjoyed seeing Ted Cruz get metaphorically punched in the face, how'd you like to see it again?

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,439
Why is it relevant, whether it will be because 90 million or 80 million or 100 million?

28
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,439
Why is that relevant?

29
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,480
Because if you don't know anything about the country, I didn't say I don't know anything

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
about it.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,480
Okay, what's the ethnic mix abroad?

32
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Oh, no.

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Oh, no.

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Oh, no.

35
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
Oh, no.

36
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Not ethnic mixes.

37
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,239
You don't want to go toe to toe with Tucker Carlson on ethnic mixes.

38
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,519
That's his best subject.

39
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,920
Look at poor Ted Cruz.

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,519
He's like, I'd like to photo-friend, please.

41
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,719
Oh, shit, I don't have any.

42
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,719
I had a waiter last night at Outback and he called me champ.

43
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
Can I phone him?

44
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,719
You know, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm starting to feel bad for Ted Cruz.

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,480
So come on, Ted, you got this.

46
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,560
They are Persians and predominantly Shia.

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Okay.

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
No, no, no.

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
It's not even, you don't know anything about Iran.

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,479
Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran, who says he's calling to go over

51
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,319
the government and he's calling to go over the country.

52
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,319
No, you don't know anything about the country.

53
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,519
This is awsome.

54
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,519
You don't know anything.

55
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:28,359
No, you don't know anything.

56
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:29,879
I don't care about who wins the fight.

57
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,239
I just like watching the fight.

58
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,719
It's like alien versus predator, but somehow more gross.

59
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,680
You can see how heated this is getting.

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,280
Clearly, Maga is much more divided about whether to overthrow Iran than they were about

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,519
whether to overthrow America.

62
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,400
I think a little comment in this interview turned into a semantic battle.

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Really believe that.

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,160
We are carrying out military strikes today.

65
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
You said Israel was.

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
Right, with our help.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm said we, Israel is leading them, but we're supporting them.

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,640
Well, this, you're breaking news here because the US government last night denied the

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,879
National Security Council spokesman Alex Pfeiffer denied on behalf of Trump that we were

70
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,600
acting on Israel's behalf in any offensive capacity.

71
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Now, we're not bombing them.

72
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Israel's bombing them.

73
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,840
You just said we were.

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
We are supporting Israel as well.

75
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
We?

76
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
I?

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
You?

78
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,840
For the party that promised no confusion around pronouns, this is really confusing.

79
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:39,240
The point is, Maga World is tearing itself apart and everyone is waiting for Trump to

80
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
make a decision.

81
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,280
And remember, Trump abruptly left the G7 summit so he could rush back to the White House, meet

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,039
with his National Security team in the situation room and decide if he's bringing America into

83
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,039
this war.

84
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,240
So, we were all waiting for the big announcement.

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
And then it came.

86
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,319
Trump said in a truth social post, it is my great honor to announce that I will be putting

87
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,120
up two beautiful flag polls on both sides of the White House and North and South Lawns.

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,719
Yes, that is definitely an announcement.

89
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,360
Not the announcement we were waiting for, but sure, have a couple flag polls installed

90
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
at the White House.

91
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,319
That will be something for the groundskeepers to take care of while you're busy in the

92
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,439
situation room dealing with more important matters.

93
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,720
At 11 o'clock we're lifting the flag, but we're going to lift the poll now and then they

94
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
go into the other side.

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Okay.

96
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,279
But I'd be out there introducing the whole thing.

97
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,480
Now, back to the situation room.

98
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,120
So we'll have one on this side of the building.

99
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,920
We'll have one on that side of the building properly placed.

100
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,519
These are the best polls anywhere in the country, in the world, actually.

101
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,519
They're tapered.

102
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,519
They have the nice top.

103
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,879
I don't know if you people are aesthetic.

104
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,879
You know they're the fake news.

105
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,879
I don't know about it.

106
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,879
I don't know there.

107
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,720
But it's a very exciting project to meet.

108
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
What's going on here?

109
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,079
Feels like someone told him, sir, you're not doing well in the polls and he was like,

110
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,560
I hear you, I'm on it.

111
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:19,759
And by the way, what was that aside about how the fake news doesn't understand flag poll

112
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,759
aesthetics?

113
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,360
I mean, this is a whole new stereotype of the liberal media I didn't even know about.

114
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,759
They live on 100 Binds laptop and they have no appreciation for tapered flag polls.

115
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,439
Now, personally, I think it's cool that Trump found a new use for the 50-foot poll that

116
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,519
Melania refuses to touch him with.

117
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:44,639
He was clearly having a good time, although he stopped himself from getting too carried

118
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,639
away.

119
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,639
Let's have a good, they call it a lifting.

120
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,000
They also use another word, but I'm not going to use that word.

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You know that is?

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,800
The word starts with an E. You know what the word is?

123
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,399
If I haven't used it, I'd be run out of town by you people.

124
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,040
All right, so enjoy it.

125
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,960
Come on, Donald.

126
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,200
You think if you say the word erection, we're going to all act like children and take it

127
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
out of context.

128
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,600
I mean, come on.

129
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Come on.

130
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,800
Where'd you get a silly idea like that?

131
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm going to come.

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Okay, y'all.

133
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:26,080
Now I remember, right.

134
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,280
It's crazy for Trump to suddenly get all worried about saying erection.

135
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,639
His closing campaign message was vote for me.

136
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,319
I saw Arnold Palmer's incredible penis.

137
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,839
But okay, you came out, you talked about flag polls, you've met the flagpole guys, you

138
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:46,399
made some flagpole-related dick jokes, time to turn around, go back inside and stop and

139
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,159
or escalate this war.

140
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,359
Let's not waste any more time.

141
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,439
Say what you want about Biden.

142
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,199
He was it for open borders.

143
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,359
He wasn't for transgender for everybody.

144
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:57,359
We don't know where it's coming from, sir.

145
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,639
I said, check out the tariffs.

146
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,040
He calls back about a day later.

147
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Wow.

148
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:08,240
Somewhere in this group, somebody that is going to captivate some movie producer, not

149
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
every Wednesday.

150
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,439
The only thing too late is Powell.

151
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,439
Powell's too late.

152
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,439
Too late, pal.

153
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,439
Let's have dinner.

154
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,439
Too late.

155
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,319
You ever have a guy that's not a smart person and you're dealing with it.

156
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,319
Any legal immigrant?

157
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,319
Thirty-five club championships.

158
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,319
You all know that.

159
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,319
Thirty-five club championships.

160
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,319
Groceries are down, eggs are down, you know the eggs.

161
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,319
You know what I do whenever they talk about Gavin Newskin?

162
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,319
I say, look at the real.

163
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,319
Austria has very, very flammable cheese.

164
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,319
Good Lord.

165
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,120
I don't want to say anything, but if your flagpole erections last more than four hours,

166
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,759
you probably want to see a doctor.

167
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,759
Donald.

168
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,759
Donald.

169
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,759
Focus.

170
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,759
Focus.

171
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,399
Focus, focus, focus.

172
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,719
Get back to the flag, Paul.

173
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:55,240
No way.

174
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Get back to the war.

175
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
I mean, war.

176
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,560
He's got me all mixed up.

177
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,839
Just someone, ask him about the war.

178
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,759
Have you even answered questions about whether you are moving closer or you believe the US

179
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,279
is moving closer to striking Iranian nuclear facilities?

180
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,279
Where's your mindset on that?

181
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,279
I may do it.

182
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,279
I may not do it.

183
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,279
I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do.

184
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,279
Right.

185
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,279
Super-helpful.

186
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,279
Thanks, guy.

187
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,000
That is the key to this whole thing.

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,120
Nobody knows what he wants to do, including Donald Trump.

189
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,159
You'd rather be doing home renovation projects than figure out how to fix all his

190
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,159
f**ks.

191
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,559
And honestly, I agree.

192
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,679
I think we should encourage him to spend all his time on landscaping projects as opposed

193
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,879
to bringing America into another Middle East war.

194
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,080
Frankly, a lot of people would be relieved by that decision, even overjoyed.

195
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,279
It might even give people...

196
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,679
I don't want to say it, but it starts with an egg.
