1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Welcome, one and all, to the late show.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,600
I'm your host, Stephen Colbert.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,600
This week on...

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,799
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,519
You can check your calendars on me here.

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,080
This weekend was the official start of summer,

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,439
as my audience knows all too well.

8
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,839
Thank you.

10
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,519
Thank you, you brave souls, for waiting outside

11
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,039
in the humidity that the weather channel has described

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,719
as the Devil's Trouser Chili.

13
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,719
LAUGHTER

14
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,719
LAUGHTER

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,039
What else is going on?

16
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:32,879
What else is going?

17
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:33,679
What else is going on?

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,719
Oh, right.

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,560
We're at war in the Middle East again.

20
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,879
At least it sure looks that way.

21
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:41,879
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

22
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:42,879
Yeah.

23
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,879
And it happened a lot sooner than anyone thought.

24
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,239
See, last week, Trump's press secretary said this.

25
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,960
I have a message directly from the president, and I quote,

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,560
based on the fact that there's a substantial chance

27
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,359
of negotiations that may or may not take place

28
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,320
with Iran in the near future.

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,160
I will make my decision whether or not to go

30
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,320
within the next two weeks.

31
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,560
That would have been perfect.

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,640
For me, because we would have been on vacation next week,

33
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,359
and I wouldn't have known any of this was happening.

34
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,240
Now I'm going to have to cancel my reservation

35
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,760
that samples Fordo.

36
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,480
LAUGHTER

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,159
But on Saturday, or just Saturday,

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,280
or there's just Saturday, and Saturday, Trump's surprised

39
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,680
the world, announcing that the US launched strikes

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,879
on three Iranian nuclear facilities.

41
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,760
Now, were we facing an imminent threat?

42
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,120
I don't know.

43
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,120
On one hand, Iran's slogan isn't life to America.

44
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,640
But it's hard to trust Donald Trump to be the one making

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,719
these kinds of decisions.

46
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,560
It kind of feels like we're all in the backseat

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,120
while the Uber driver goes on a road rage.

48
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,240
Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy, we're in the car, too, OK?

49
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,280
And if we're dead, we can't give you five stars.

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,199
That's my...

51
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:02,439
That is my heart rule for rating drivers.

52
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,239
I'm dead.

53
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,399
No.

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,919
Arrival live?

55
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,919
I'm giving five.

56
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,280
Trump addressed the nation for a couple of minutes

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,319
later on Saturday night, and wrapped it up in just the weirdest way.

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,560
I want to just thank everybody, and in particular,

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,000
God, I want to just say, we love you God,

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,520
and we love our great military, protect them.

61
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,599
OK, it's a nice sentiment, you know,

62
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,520
but a weird way to say it.

63
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Yes, I have always been a devout believer in God.

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,439
We love you God.

65
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,520
I know we haven't always been on the greatest terms

66
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,560
since I made the deal with a guy with a polkae

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,759
in the Flamengoves.

68
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,759
But point is, you rock, big guy.

69
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,560
Stay in school.

70
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Have a great summer, Namaste.

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,759
LAUGHTER

72
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,759
Namaste.

73
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,759
Namaste.

74
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,640
After the bombs were dropped on Sunday,

75
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,599
Trump posted this message with a key misspelling.

76
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,439
The great B-2 pilots have just landed safely in Missouri.

77
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,920
Thank you for a job.

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,520
Well done.

79
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,840
Donucked J. Trump, president of the United States.

80
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Yes.

81
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Yes.

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
OK.

83
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Yeah.

84
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Yes.

85
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:37,560
Donucked J. Trump, spoken like a man who got Donucked in Denoggan.

86
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,480
We're learning more about the actual bombing, the attack plan.

87
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,320
It's codename Operation Midnight Hammer.

88
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,239
And no, it's not porn.

89
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,239
LAUGHTER

90
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,919
Yet.

91
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,919
Here's what happened.

92
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,759
In order to avoid detection, the plan was carried out

93
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,799
by seven B-2 stealth bombers.

94
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,000
And I'm, is this true?

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,359
I'm told we have a picture of the stealth planes.

96
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:04,959
Wow.

97
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,560
They are good.

98
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,400
The planes were carrying 30,000-pound bombs

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,840
known as bunker busters, officially called Mops

100
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,560
or massive ordinance penetrators.

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,920
The most, most phallic sounding weapons

102
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,959
since the Tomahawk cruise trance.

103
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,920
So America spies must have truly compelling intelligence,

104
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,560
indicating that Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon

105
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,360
or not, because America spies that Iran wasn't

106
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,160
building a nuclear weapon.

107
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,920
OK.

108
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,639
OK.

109
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,439
Hold on.

110
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,079
Are they sure?

111
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,920
Maybe our top spies just didn't have time to do a thorough check

112
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,640
because they were too busy hanging off of a biplane.

113
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,199
But if the intelligence wasn't there,

114
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,040
how did Trump decide it was time to attack Iran's nuclear

115
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,920
program?

116
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,439
Well, according to a senior administration official,

117
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:03,600
it was based on a feeling the president had.

118
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,360
If you are making a decision that could

119
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,920
endanger the lives of American troops and civilians,

120
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,439
help me out.

121
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,560
Legal scholars, what does that require?

122
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Thank you.

123
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Hey, Mayor.

124
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Thank you.

125
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Hey, Mayor.

126
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Thank you.

127
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Thank you for your service.

128
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,920
And thank you for that staff.

129
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,920
And remember, this is an America's first military industrial

130
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
rodeo.

131
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,400
I've been making jokes about whether or not

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,280
we should be going to war in the Middle East for 22 years.

133
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,520
I did jokes from the Middle East for the service people

134
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,280
who were sent into harm's way based on no credible intelligence.

135
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,319
But I will say this.

136
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,119
I will say this.

137
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:45,639
Sure, sure.

138
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,599
I will say this about the Bush administration.

139
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:51,359
At least they respected us enough to lie to us.

140
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:54,239
Apparently, the Trump administration does not give a damn

141
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,399
what we think.

142
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,279
They're not presenting any evidence.

143
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,679
Just come on, guys.

144
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,079
Just at least scare us a little.

145
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,599
I missed the days when Colin Powell went to the UN Security

146
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,839
Council and passionately waved a tube of country time

147
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,599
lemonade powder.

148
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
I mean, just that much, just that much of the powder

149
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,480
could have refreshed everyone in that building.

150
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,160
Trump should be out there telling us

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,520
that Iran is hiding 50 tons of mustard gas on a turkey farm,

152
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,280
or 50 tons of mustard turkey on a gas farm,

153
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,720
or human animal hybrids, or anything.

154
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
Just sell it with sizzle.

155
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,800
This is just lazy.

156
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,240
It's got low production value.

157
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,600
As imagine, if the next Transformers movie was just like,

158
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,120
you know what?

159
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,439
I think we're just going to state cars in this one.

160
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,600
Put some effort in.

161
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
I know.

162
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,279
No, I'm mad.

163
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,600
This isn't me, mad.

164
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,199
What's going to happen next?

165
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,800
Whatever happens next, you know they're

166
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,079
going to make JD Vance go on TV and embarrass himself.

167
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,279
Because here's what he said on Sunday

168
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,319
to sell this war that is definitely not a war.

169
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,879
Is the United States now at war with Iran?

170
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,360
No, we're not at war with Iran.

171
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,000
John, we're at war with Iran's nuclear program.

172
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,639
Nope, nope.

173
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,040
That's not how it works.

174
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,879
Honey, I'm not cheating on you with Stacey.

175
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,959
I'm cheating on you with parts of Stacey.

176
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,920
Very selective.

177
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,399
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

178
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,639
And yes.

179
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,839
And yes, we do call it Operation Midnight Hammer.

180
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,879
Then...

181
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,879
Pretty.

182
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,879
OK.

183
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,360
Then JD Sauntered Over To Press the Meat with Kristen Welker.

184
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,000
What do you say to members of Congress

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,560
who say it was unconstitutional for the president

186
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,719
to act unilaterally?

187
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:57,000
First of all, the president has clear authority

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,480
to act to prevent the proliferation of weapons

189
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,719
of mass destruction.

190
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,959
And the worst weapon of mass destruction of them all

191
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,399
is nuclear.

192
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,199
Debatable.

193
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,240
From my money, the worst weapon of mass destruction

194
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,039
is the Taco Bell Triple Lupa.

195
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:13,879
LAUGHTER

196
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,439
If this all feels like deja vu,

197
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,680
Vance promises, this time is different.

198
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,120
I certainly empathize with Americans who are exhausted

199
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,759
after 25 years of foreign entanglements in the Middle East.

200
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,120
But the difference is that back then,

201
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,800
we had dumb presidents.

202
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Yes.

203
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,480
Yes.

204
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,720
Back then...

205
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,639
He's got a point.

206
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,919
Back then, we had dumb presidents.

207
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,559
And now we have Donak J. Trump.

208
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
LAUGHTER

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,759
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

210
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,759
And the other guy...

211
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,960
Thank you, guys.

212
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
That was very nice.

213
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,159
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

214
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,159
He...

215
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,480
He is smart.

216
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,399
LAUGHTER

217
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,439
You'll remember back in 2003, the US-Winter to Iraq

218
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,639
with the specific goal of toppling Saddam Hussein.

219
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,080
This time, Vance promises.

220
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,879
That's not the idea.

221
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,320
Does the United States support Israel killing Iran's leader?

222
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,759
Well, look, that's up to the Israelis,

223
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,879
but our view has been very clear that we don't want a regime change.

224
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,080
OK, great, loud and very clear

225
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,080
and immediately contradicted by the president, who posted,

226
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,840
it's not politically correct to use the term regime change.

227
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,759
But if the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again...

228
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,639
Why wouldn't there be a regime change?

229
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,639
Miga.

230
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,000
LAUGHTER

231
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,279
Miga?

232
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,279
Miga?

233
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,279
What?

234
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,399
Miga, your whole damn thing is America first.

235
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,480
You can't just hand other countries your slogan.

236
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,960
That's like if McDonald's had an ad campaign that said,

237
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm loving it, it being Burger King.

238
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,120
LAUGHTER

239
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
No.

240
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,799
No.

241
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,799
I'm mad.

242
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,399
No.

243
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,799
God, bless it.

244
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,759
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

245
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,759
Sorry, you had to see it.

246
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,759
What's that thing?

247
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,759
Let it out, let it out.

248
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,839
Today, Iran launched missiles against two U.S. bases,

249
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,919
including one in Qatar, but both Qatar and the Trump administration

250
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,799
were made aware of the Iranian attack ahead of time.

251
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,719
And so thankfully, no casualties were reported.

252
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,879
Hopefully, that'll be the end.

253
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,079
But who knows?

254
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,079
Because immediately after the strikes on Saturday,

255
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,400
Iran warned there would be everlasting consequences.

256
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,639
Everlasting consequences.

257
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,280
Also, the slogan of Taco Bell's Triple Lupa.

258
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,440
We got a great show tonight.

259
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,040
My guests are Jesus Elba and U.S.E. Merrill Carries,

260
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,480
Zoran Mamdani and Brad Land.

261
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,600
When we come back, I'll tell you more about that race.

262
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,920
It's minutes.

263
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,879
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
