1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
than anyone thought.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,240
As he last week, Trump's press secretary said this.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,480
I have a message directly from the president, and I quote,

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,800
based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,320
take place with Iran in the near future.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,519
I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,760
That would have been perfect for me, because we would have been on vacation next week,

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,519
and I wouldn't have known any of this was happening.

9
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,759
Now I'm going to have to cancel my reservation that sandals fordo.

10
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,000
But on Saturday, or just Saturday, or just Saturday,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,879
and Saturday, Trump surprised the world, announcing that the U.S.

12
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,039
launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.

13
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,879
Now, were we facing an imminent threat?

14
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,280
I don't know.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,280
On one hand, Iran's slogan isn't life to America,

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,280
but it's hard to trust Donald Trump to be the one making these kinds

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,719
of decisions. It kind of feels like we're all in the backseat

18
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,159
while the Uber driver goes on a road rage.

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,359
Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy, we're in the car, too, okay?

20
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,560
And if we're dead, we can't give you five stars.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,400
That's my...

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,640
That is my heart rule for rating drivers.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,439
I'm dead.

24
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,599
No.

25
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,079
Arrival live?

26
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:26,319
I'm giving five.

27
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,599
Trump addressed the nation for a couple minutes later on Saturday night

28
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,279
and wrapped it up in just the weirdest way.

29
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:38,519
I want to just thank everybody, and in particular, God,

30
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,919
I want to just say, we love you, God,

31
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,479
and we love our great military, protect them.

32
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,560
Okay, it's a nice sentiment, you know,

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,479
but a weird way to say it.

34
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,959
Yes, I have always been a devout believer in God.

35
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,479
We love you, God. I know.

36
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,559
We haven't always been on the greatest terms since I made the deal

37
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,359
with the guy with the Pokeyhead and the Flamenhoofs.

38
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,599
But point is, you rock, big guy.

39
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,599
Stay in school, have a great summer, Namaste.

40
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,599
LAUGHTER

41
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,000
Namaste.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Namaste.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,599
CHEERING

44
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,519
After the bombs were dropped on Sunday,

45
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,400
Trump posted this message with a key misspelling.

46
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:29,280
The great B-2 pilots have just landed safely in Missouri.

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,840
Thank you for a job.

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,480
Well done.

49
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,599
Donucked J-Trump.

50
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,319
President of the United States. Yes.

51
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,599
CHEERING

52
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,599
Yes.

53
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,599
Yes.

54
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,800
Donucked.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,480
J-Trump. Spoken like a man who got Donucked in Denoggin.

56
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,399
We're learning more about the actual bombing, the attack plan.

57
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:59,280
It's codename Operation Midnight Hammer.

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
And no, it's not porn.

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,120
LAUGHTER

60
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Yet.

61
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,919
LAUGHTER

62
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,759
Here's what happened. In order to avoid detection, the plan was carried out

63
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,759
by seven B-2 stealth bombers.

64
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,319
And I'm, is this true? I'm told we have a picture of the stealth planes.

65
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,319
Wow!

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,479
They are good.

67
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,000
The plans were carrying 30,000-pound bombs known as bunker busters,

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,439
officially called mobs, or massive ordinance penetrators.

69
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,439
The most...

70
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,719
most phallic-sounding weapon since the...

71
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,840
Tomahawk cruise shunts.

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,840
So America spies must have truly compelling intelligence,

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,479
indicating that Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon,

74
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,479
or...

75
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,240
or not, because America spies that Iran wasn't.

76
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,040
Building a nuclear weapon.

77
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,960
OK. OK. Hold on. Are they sure?

78
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,800
Maybe our top spies just didn't have time to do a thorough check,

79
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,439
because they were too busy hanging off of a biplane.

80
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,520
LAUGHTER

81
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,640
But, if the intelligence wasn't there, how did Trump decide it was time

82
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,800
to attack Iran's nuclear program?

83
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,320
Well, according to a senior administration official,

84
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,879
it was based on a feeling...

85
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,480
the president had.

86
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,480
If you are making a decision that could endanger the lives

87
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,280
of American troops and civilians, help me out.

88
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Legal scholars, what does that require?

89
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,040
THEY CONFER

90
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,840
THEY CONFER

91
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Thank you. Thank you.

92
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,080
Thank you. Thank you.

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

94
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,280
Thank you for your service.

95
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,840
Thank you for that staff.

96
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,720
And remember, this is an America's first military industrial rodeo.

97
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,720
I've been making jokes about whether or not we should be going

98
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,240
to war in the Middle East for 22 years.

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,480
I did jokes from the Middle East for the service people

100
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,240
who were sent into harm's way based on no credible intelligence.

101
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,280
But I will say this.

102
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,560
I will say this, sure.

103
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,600
I will say this about the Bush administration.

104
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,320
At least they respected us enough to lie to us.

105
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,360
Apparently, the Trump administration does not give a damn what we think.

106
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,280
They're not presenting any evidence.

107
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,679
Just come on, guys.

108
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:16,039
Just at least scare us a little.

109
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:19,039
I missed the days when Colin Powell went to the UN Security Council

110
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,519
and passionately waved a tube of country-time lemonade powder.

111
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,759
I mean, just that much, just that much of the powder

112
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,199
could have refreshed everyone in that building.

113
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,119
I mean, Trump should be out there telling us

114
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:36,439
that Iran is hiding 50 tons of mustard gas on a turkey farm

115
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,239
or 50 tons of mustard turkey on a gas farm

116
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,679
or human animal hybrids or anything.

117
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,160
And just sell it with sizzle.

118
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,800
This is just lazy.

119
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
It's got low production value.

120
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,639
As imagine, if the next Transformers movie was just like,

121
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,160
you know what?

122
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,480
I think we're just going to state cars in this one.

123
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,600
Put some effort in.

124
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,319
I'm mad.

125
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,600
This isn't me, mad.

126
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
What's going to happen next?

127
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,800
Whatever happens next, you know they're

128
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,040
going to make JD Vance go on TV and embarrass himself.

129
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,280
Because here's what he said on Sunday

130
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,319
to sell this war that is definitely not a war.

131
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,879
Is the United States now at war with Iran?

132
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,360
No, we're not at war with Iran.

133
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,040
John, war with Iran's nuclear program.

134
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,639
Nope, nope.

135
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,040
That's not how it works.

136
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,920
Honey, I'm not cheating on you with Stacy.

137
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,960
I'm cheating on you with parts of Stacy.

138
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Very selective.

139
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,600
And yes.

140
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,800
And yes, we do call it Operation Midnight Hammer.

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Then.

142
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Pretty.

143
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Pretty.

144
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Okay.

145
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Then JD Sauntered over to press the meat with Kristen Welker.

146
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
What do you say to members of Congress

147
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
who say it was unconstitutional for the president

148
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
to act unilaterally?

149
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,040
First of all, the president has clear authority

150
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,800
to act to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction

151
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,480
and the worst weapon of mass destruction of them all is nuclear.

152
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,280
Debatable.

153
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,319
From my money, the worst weapon of mass destruction

154
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,280
is the Taco Bell Tripleupa.

155
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,480
If this all feels like deja vu, Vance promises,

156
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,759
this time is different.

157
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,240
I certainly empathize with Americans who are exhausted

158
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,800
after 25 years of foreign entanglements in the Middle East.

159
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,840
But the difference is that back then, we had dumb presidents.

160
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Yes.

161
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,639
Yes.

162
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,840
Back then.

163
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,680
He's got a point.

164
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,000
Back then, we had dumb presidents.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,480
And now we have Donak J. Trump.

166
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Yeah.

167
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Yeah.

168
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
And more than that.

169
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Thank you, guys.

170
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
It was very nice.

171
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
It was very nice.

172
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Yeah.

173
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,480
He is smart.

174
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,480
You'll remember back in 2003, the US went into Iraq

175
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,480
with the specific goal of toppling Saddam Hussein.

176
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,480
This time, Vance promises, that's not the idea.

177
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Does the United States support Israel killing Iran's leader?

178
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Well, look, that's up to the Israelis.

179
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
But our view has been very clear that we don't want a regime change.

180
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
OK.

181
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Great.

182
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Loud and very clear and immediately contradicted by the president,

183
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,480
who posted, it's not politically correct to use the term regime change.

184
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,480
But if the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again,

185
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,480
why wouldn't there be a regime change?

186
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Miga.

187
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Miga.

188
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Miga.

189
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Because your whole damn thing is America first.

190
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,480
You can't just hand other countries your slogan.

191
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,480
That's like if McDonald's had an ad campaign that said,

192
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,480
I'm loving it, it being Burger King.

193
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
No.

194
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
No.

195
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
I'm mad.

196
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
No.

197
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
God bless it.

198
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Sorry, you had to see it.

199
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Let it out.

200
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Today, a Ron launched missiles against two U.S. bases,

201
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,480
including one in Qatar, but both Qatar and the Trump administration

202
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,480
were made aware of the Iranian attack ahead of time.
