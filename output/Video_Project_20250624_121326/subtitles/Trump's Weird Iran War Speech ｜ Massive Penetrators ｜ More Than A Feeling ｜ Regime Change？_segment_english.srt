1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Welcome one and all to the late show.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,600
I'm your host, Stephen Colbert.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,600
This will go.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,799
Oh, my God.

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,500
You can check your calendars on me here.

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,099
This weekend was the official start of summer,

7
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:15,939
as my audience knows all too well.

8
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:17,879
Thank you.

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,539
Thank you, you brave souls, for waiting outside

10
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:23,039
and the humidity that the Weather Channel has described

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,580
as the Devil's Trouser Chili.

12
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:31,079
What else is going on?

13
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,079
What else is going on?

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,079
What else is going on?

15
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,079
What else is going on?

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,079
Oh, right.

17
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,079
We're at war in the Middle East again.

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,079
At least it sure looks that way.

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,079
Yeah.

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,079
And it happened a lot sooner than anyone thought.

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,079
See, last week, Trump's press secretary said this.

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,079
I have a message directly from the president, and I quote,

23
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,579
based on the fact that there's a substantial chance

24
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,379
of negotiations that may or may not take place

25
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,379
with Iran in the near future.

26
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:02,379
I will make my decision whether or not

27
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:05,379
to go within the next two weeks.

28
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,859
That would have been perfect for me,

29
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,680
because we would have been on vacation next week,

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,420
and I wouldn't have known any of this was happening.

31
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,280
Now I'm going to have to cancel my reservation

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,579
that Samples Fordo.

33
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,180
But on Saturday, or just Saturday,

34
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,180
or just Saturday, and Saturday, Trump surprised the world,

35
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,680
announcing that the U.S. launch strikes

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,880
on three Iranian nuclear facilities.

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,780
Now, were we facing an imminent threat?

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,080
I don't know.

39
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,080
On one hand, Iran's slogan isn't life to America.

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,680
But it's hard to trust Donald Trump

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
to be the one making these kinds of decisions.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,580
It kind of feels like we're all in the backseat

43
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,080
while the Uber driver goes on a road rage.

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,480
Hey, hey, hey, buddy, we're in the car, too.

45
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
Okay?

46
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,280
And if we're dead, we can't give you five stars.

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
That's my...

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,280
That is my heart rule for rating drivers.

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,280
I'm dead.

50
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,479
No.

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,980
Arrivalive?

52
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,979
I'm giving five.

53
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,280
Trump addressed the nation for a couple of minutes

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,780
later on Saturday night, and wrapped it up

55
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,379
in just the weirdest way.

56
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:22,579
I want to just thank everybody, and in particular,

57
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,979
God, I want to just say, we love you, God,

58
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,579
and we love our great military, protect them.

59
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:31,579
Okay, it's a nice sentiment, you know?

60
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:34,579
But a weird way to say it.

61
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:41,379
Yes, I have always been a devout believer in God.

62
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,579
We love you, God.

63
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,579
I know.

64
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,579
We haven't always been on the greatest terms

65
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,780
since I made the deal with a guy with a polkae head

66
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,780
and the Flamenhoes.

67
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,780
But point is, you rock, big guy.

68
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,780
Stay in school.

69
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,780
Have a great summer, Namaste.

70
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,780
Namaste.

71
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,780
Namaste.

72
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,580
After the bombs were dropped on Sunday,

73
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,580
Trump posted this message with a key misspelling.

74
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,380
The great B-2 pilots have just landed safely in Missouri.

75
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,780
Thank you for a job.

76
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,579
Well done.

77
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,579
Donucked, J-Trump.

78
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,780
President of the United States.

79
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,579
Yes.

80
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,579
Yes.

81
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,579
Okay.

82
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,579
Yes.

83
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,780
Donucked.

84
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,579
J-Trump, spoken like a man who got Donucked in Denog.

85
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:41,379
We're learning more about the actual bombing, the attack plan.

86
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:44,180
It's codename Operation Midnight Hammer.

87
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,180
And no, it's not porn.

88
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,180
LAUGHTER

89
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,780
Yet.

90
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,780
Here's what happened.

91
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,579
In order to avoid detection, the plan was carried out

92
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:58,579
by seven B-2 stealth bombers.

93
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,579
And I'm... Is this true?

94
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:02,180
I'm told we have a picture of the stealth planes.

95
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,180
Wow.

96
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,979
Yeah.

97
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,579
They are good.

98
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:10,379
The planes were carrying 30,000-pound bombs

99
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,780
known as bunker busters, officially called mobs,

100
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,579
or massive ordinance penetrators.

101
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,579
The most...

102
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,779
The most phallic-sounding weapon since the...

103
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,779
Tomahawk cruise shunts.

104
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:25,779
So America spies must have truly compelling intelligence,

105
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:29,579
indicating that Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon,

106
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:34,379
or... or not, because America spies that Iran wasn't

107
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,180
building a nuclear weapon.

108
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,180
Okay.

109
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,180
Okay.

110
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,180
Hold on.

111
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,180
Are they sure?

112
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,980
Maybe our top spies just didn't have time to do a thorough check

113
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,579
because they were too busy hanging off of a biplane.

114
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:47,579
LAUGHTER

115
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,180
But if the intelligence wasn't there, how did Trump decide

116
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,980
it was time to attack Iran's nuclear program?

117
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,379
Well, according to a senior administration official,

118
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,980
it was based on a feeling...

119
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,980
LAUGHTER

120
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,980
The president had.

121
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,579
CHEERING

122
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,180
If you are making a decision that could endanger the lives

123
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,379
of American troops and civilians, help me out.

124
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,579
Legal scholars, what does that require?

125
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,579
MUSIC

126
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:15,579
Thank you.

127
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:16,579
Hey, Mayor. Thank you.

128
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:17,579
Hey, Mayor.

129
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:18,579
And thank you.

130
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,980
CHEERING

131
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,980
Thank you for your service.

132
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,779
Thank you for that staff.

133
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,779
And remember, this is an America's first military industrial rodeo.

134
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,779
I've been making jokes about whether or not we should be going

135
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,180
to war in the Middle East for 22 years.

136
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,379
I did jokes from the Middle East for the service people

137
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,180
who were sent into harm's way based on no credible intelligence.

138
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,180
But I will say this.

139
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,180
I will say this, sure.

140
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,579
I will say this about the Bush administration.

141
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:51,180
At least they respected us enough to lie to us.

142
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,180
Apparently, the Trump administration does not give a damn

143
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,180
what we think.

144
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,180
They're not presenting any evidence.

145
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,579
Just come on, guys.

146
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,980
Just at least scare us a little.

147
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,980
I missed the days when Colin Powell went to the UN Security Council

148
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,980
and passionately waved a tube of country-time lemonade powder.

149
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,980
I mean, just that much, just that much of the powder

150
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,980
could have refreshed everyone in that building.

151
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,980
I mean, Trump should be out there telling us

152
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,980
that Iran is hiding 50 tons of mustard gas on a turkey farm

153
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,980
or 50 tons of mustard turkey on a gas farm

154
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,980
or human animal hybrids or anything.

155
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
Just sell it with sizzle.

156
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,980
This is just lazy.

157
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,980
It's got low production values.

158
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
Imagine if the next Transformers movie was just like,

159
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,980
you know what?

160
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
I think we're just going to state cars in this one.

161
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
What?

162
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,980
Put some effort in.

163
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
I'm mad.

164
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
This isn't me, mad.

165
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,980
What's going to happen next?

166
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,980
Whatever happens next, you know they're going to make

167
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,980
JD Vance go on TV and embarrass himself.

168
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Because here's what he said on Sunday to sell this war

169
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
that is definitely not a war.

170
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,980
Is the United States now at war with Iran?

171
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,980
No, we're not at war with Iran.

172
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,980
John, we're at war with Iran's nuclear program.

173
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,980
Nope, nope.

174
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,980
That's not how it works.

175
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,980
Honey, I'm not cheating on you with Stacey.

176
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,980
I'm cheating on you with parts of Stacey.

177
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,980
Very selective.

178
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,980
And yes.

179
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,980
And yes, we do call it Operation Midnight Hammer.

180
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,980
Then.

181
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,980
Pretty easy.

182
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,980
Okay.

183
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,980
Then JD Sauntered Over to Press the Meet with Kristen Welker.

184
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,980
What do you say to members of Congress who say it was

185
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,980
unconstitutional for the president to act unilaterally?

186
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,980
First of all, the president has clear authority to act

187
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,980
to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

188
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,980
And the worst weapon of mass destruction of them all is nuclear.

189
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,980
Debatable.

190
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,980
From my money, the worst weapon of mass destruction

191
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,980
is the Taco Bell Triple Lupa.

192
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,980
If this all feels like deja vu, Vance promises this time is different.

193
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,980
I certainly empathize with Americans who are exhausted after 25 years

194
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
of foreign entanglements in the Middle East.

195
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,980
But the difference is that back then we had dumb presidents.

196
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Yes.

197
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Yes.

198
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,980
Back then.

199
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
He's got a point.

200
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,980
Back then we had dumb presidents.

201
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,980
And now we have Donak J. Trump.

202
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,980
He is smart.

203
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,980
You'll remember back in 2003, the US winner of Iraq

204
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,980
with the specific goal of toppling Saddam Hussein.

205
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,980
This time, Vance promises that's not the idea.

206
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Does the United States support Israel killing Iran's leader?

207
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
Yes.

208
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Yes.

209
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
Yes.

210
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Yes.

211
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Yes.

212
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,980
Yes.

213
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,980
Yes.

214
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
Yes.

215
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,980
Yes.

216
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
Yes.

217
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,980
Yes.

218
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,980
Yes.

219
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Yes.

220
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,980
Yes.

221
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Yes.

222
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
Yes.

223
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
Yes.

224
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
Yes.

225
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,980
Yes.

226
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,980
Yes.

227
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
Well, look, that's up to the Israelis.

228
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,980
But our view has been very clear that we don't want a regime change.

229
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Okay.

230
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
Great.

231
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,980
Loud and very clear and immediately contradicted by the president,

232
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,980
who posted,

233
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,980
it's not politely correct to use the term regime change.

234
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,980
Mega.

235
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,980
Mega.

236
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,980
Mega, your whole damn thing is America first.

237
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,980
You can't just hand other countries your slogan.

238
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,980
That's like if McDonald's had an ad campaign that said,

239
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,980
I'm loving it, it being Burger King.

240
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
No.

241
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
No.

242
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
I'm mad.

243
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,980
No.

244
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,980
God, bless it.

245
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
I'm sorry you had to see it.

246
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
Let it out.

247
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
Let it out.

248
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,980
Today, a Ron launched missiles against two U.S. bases,

249
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,980
including one in Qatar, but both Qatar and the Trump administration

250
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,980
were made aware of the Iranian attack ahead of time.
